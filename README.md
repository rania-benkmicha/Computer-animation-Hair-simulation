# Computer-animation-Hair-simulation

This project takes part as an application of Computer
animation courseâ€™ theoretical knowledge as we implemented a hair simulation.We
used **Computer Graphics Programming Library** **-CGP-** and **Blender** for environment
preparation.Then,we tried to implement the real hair simulation on head shape
taking into account applied forces and handling collisions.
